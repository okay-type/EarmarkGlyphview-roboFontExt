What does this extension do? It adds a triangle in the upper right corner of Robofont's glyph edit window showing the current glyph's markColor. If there is no markColor, the triangle is a greyish placeholder. In the future it would be neat to add a menu to change the current glyph's markColor from a dropdown list. But I usually use keyboard shortcuts to change my markColor so it's not something I'm working on.
